Help us locate your project in the Plonky3 or circom landscape and what problems/areas it tries to solve/explore by answering each of these questions:

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the zk ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project/research different? Please identify and assess any projects addressing the same need and explain how your project is distinct. Feel free to include applicable research data, statistics, or metrics.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to zkBankai, SoulForge, or the relevant ecosystem. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g., 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (e.g., 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g., 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on funding requested.

### Milestone 1 Example — Basic functionality

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:** 1.5
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD
