## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline (one-sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into plonky3 or circom.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details

We expect teams to already have a solid idea about their project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components if there are any.
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality.
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed.
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic.
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations that might not be obvious.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the plonky3 or circom landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the zk ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different? Please identify and assess any projects addressing the same need and explain how your project is distinct. Feel free to include applicable research data, statistics, or metrics.
  - If not, please indicate why such a project might not have been possible, successful, or attempted.
- Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to zkBankai, SoulForge, or the relevant ecosystem. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g., 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (e.g., 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g., 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on funding requested.

### Milestone 1 Example — Basic functionality

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:** 1.5
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD

> **The default deliverables 0a-0c below are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one.

| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense. |
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our project and send test transactions, showing how the new functionality works. |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| **0d.** | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone if any. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains what was done/achieved as part of the grant. (Content, language, and medium should reflect your target audience described above.) |
